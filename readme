# eyes

This is a project I completed that moves the "eyes" in time with the users mouse. It's simple to run, just insert the code in whatever browser platform, and move your mouse to see the eyes move! 

<h2>How To Run</h2>
Download or clone the project
Go to content folder and add it to your code editor tool
Open index.html

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
Add a blinking feature when clicking.
